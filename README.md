# chrome-history-profiling

## Intro/Background

Web Browse Forensic is my interest topic. In this repository, I developed the chrome history analyzer.
It is usually hard to remove your tasks because you cannot understant botlnecks easily in developing process.
Also duplication of searching something about development tech is non-efficient action.
This analyzer helps you to understand it, and finally aggreate your search logs somewherer such as local device.

## Requirement

- Python 3.7

## Run

```
git clone https://github.com/jAkatsubaki/chrome-history-profiling.git
cd chrome-hitory-profiling
python main.py
```

After program running, some files saved in `chrprofiler` directory
